          <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p> I was a member of the National Honor Society in junior high school. I then spent three years in tenth grade because I became more interested in girls, cars, partying and rock and roll. I bounced around alot between Houston, Austin, Terlingua and northern California for a few years having a wonderfull time.</p>
        <p>Then I was married in 1987 and had to settle down so I worked as a mechanic, a machinist, carpenter, cook etc...</p>
        <p>In 1989 I was hired at a civil engineering firm in Houston to hold the stick on a survey crew. I took a surveying class at the community collage and within six months I was running my own crew. As time progressed I had a couple of children and transferred departments at work to become a "Field Project Representative" (inspector and liason for civil engineering projects).</p>
        <p><strong>Things were going great!</strong></p>
        <p>In 1994 we won a sum of money from the Texas Lottery, quit our jobs and moved to Terlingua, Texas to start a new life.</p>
        <p>I started a mechanic shop and took a job as superintendant for a local mining company. After that played out I was hired by the Study Butte Water Supply Corporation in 1998 as their manager and inspector. Working with state and federal funding we contracted to build from the ground up a non-profit community potable water supply. In 1998 I also started a company called Terlingua Gem and Mineral which was quite lucrative until I had to ramp down due to water company obligations.</p>
        <p>In 2012 I was able to win my way into a World Poker Tour Tournament and realized I could make money playing cards. I resigned my position with the water company, started travelling part time to play poker and took a job at a local restaurant and bar as a part time bartender.</p>
        <p>In 2015 I realized that I did not want to continue with the bartending lifestyle (I seldom drink anymore) and did not want to keep travelling so much (I like flying but I dislike crowded airports) or being away from home frequently. I quit my job, bought a motorhome and am now a full time RV'er with my S.O.</p>

      <h1>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h1>
        <p>I discovered my love for computing when I received a Timex Sinclair as a gift when I was eightteen years old. There were no programs available so I had to learn Basic and dabbled in machine code a bit. I decided that I needed to learn how to work with computer hardware after a technician wiped the hard drive on a critical machine at my job and have done all my own modifications and repairs since then. I believe skills in programming will further my adventure in computing and allow for a mobile lifestyle in the future.</p>
